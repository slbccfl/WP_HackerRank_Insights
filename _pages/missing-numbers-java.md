I implemented this using the functionality of Java data structures. The lists of numbers are collected as a list of integers. Each number in the first list is used to execute a remove method against the second list. The resulting list is converted into a SortedSet to remove duplicates and sort the resulting list. The resulting set is used to build a string for displaying the integers.
