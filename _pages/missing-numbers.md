Reconciliation of two lists of numbers. The required output is a sorted list of numbers missing from the first list that are in the second. Numbers may occur in each list multiple times and each must be considered as a unique occurrence and considered missing if there are not enough occurrences in the first list for all the occurrences in the second list. But the final output should only have one occurrence of each missing number.
