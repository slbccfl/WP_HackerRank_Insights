## Purpose:

Originally this repository was to contain my efforts to use Eclipse and Java to solve coding exercises available on the HackerRank website. I also used JUnit to employ TDD (Test Driven Development) in more advanced exercises. More recently I restructured this repository to hold JavaScript solutions as well as Java. I have used JavaScript to solve many of the same problems I completed in Java. In the case of JavaScript I have used Visual Studio Code as IDE and I am planning on using Jasmine for testing as I moved into more advanced problems.

        <li>
          My own code - While I have investigated solutions broadly, I have developed my own coding solutions for each of these exercises.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use Standards - As I have developed these solutions I have sought to employ the standards most favored by the software industry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Code to Learn - In some cases I have employed data structures or approached problems in such a way as to give myself more of an opportunity to learn about language specific functionality, data structures or advanced algorithms and problem solving methodologies.
