This is a collection of challenges from the [HackerRank][1] website and the solutions that I have coded in Java and JavaScript. In many cases I have solved the same problem in both languages. In the sidebar you will find a menu of these challenges with submenus for each solution. Links are provided to the original problem definition on the HackerRank website and the solution pages will provide some observations I have made about my approach to solving the problem and a link to the code in one of my GitHub repositories. I would be very interested in any comments that you are willing to share. I do ask that you register to make comments. Â
