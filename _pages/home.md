This is a collection of challenges from the <a href="http://hackerrank.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HackerRank</a> website and the solutions that I have coded in Java and JavaScript. In many cases I have solved the same problem in both languages. In the sidebar you will find a menu of these challenges with sub-menus for each solution. Below this menu of challenges you will find the an inventory of tags that have been applied to these pages. This may help you find subjects of interest to you. In these pages, links are provided to the original problem definition on the HackerRank website and the solution pages will provide some observations I have made about my approach to solving the problem and a link to the code I submitted. Almost all of these solutions have been accepted as successful by the HackerRank website. There are a few particularly difficult problems that I have attempted and my solution has not been accepted for all test cases. I make this clear in my comments about the solution. I would be very interested in any comments that you are willing to share. I do ask that you register to make comments. Â
